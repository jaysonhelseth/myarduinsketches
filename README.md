# My Arduino Sketches

Sketches for Arduino boards. Some are actually main.cpp files from platformIO projects. Either way, this is a place to store them so I don't lose them in the future. I am not storing the whole project because these may just be used as examples or modified based on the board they are used on.

Since I added the files without the libraries I don't have to be so picky with the licenses.
